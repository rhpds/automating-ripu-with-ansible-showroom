=== Step 1 - RHEL In-place Upgrade Automation Workflow

Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) comes with the Leapp utility, the
underlying framework that our automation approach uses to upgrade the
operating system to the next major version. The
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html-single/upgrading_from_rhel_7_to_rhel_8/index[Leapp
documentation] guides users on how to use the Leapp framework to
manually upgrade a RHEL host. This is fine if you only have a few RHEL
hosts to upgrade, but what if you are a large enterprise with tens of
thousands of RHEL hosts? The manual process does not scale. Using
automation, the end-to-end process for upgrading a RHEL host is reduced
to a matter of days and the total downtime required for the actual
upgrade is measured in hours or less.

Our RHEL in-place upgrade automation approach follows a workflow with
three phases:

indicates workflow steps that are automated by Ansible playbooks.

==== *Analysis*

During the analysis phase, no changes are made yet. When the analysis
playbook is executed, it uses the Leapp utility to scan the host for
issues or blockers that may prevent a successful upgrade. Then it
generates a detailed report listing any potential risks found. The
report also includes recommended actions that should be followed to
reduce the likelihood of the reported issues impacting the upgrade. If
any recommended remediation actions are performed, the analysis scan
should be run again to verify the risks are resolved. This iteration
continues until everyone reviewing the report is comfortable that any
remaining findings are acceptable.

==== *Upgrade*

After the analysis phase is done and the report indicates acceptable
risk, a maintenance window can be scheduled and the upgrade phase can
begin. It is during this phase that the upgrade playbooks are executed
using a workflow job template. The first playbook creates a snapshot
that can be used for rolling back if anything goes wrong with the
upgrade. After the snapshot is created, the second playbook uses the
Leapp utility to perform the upgrade where the RHEL OS is advanced to
the new major version. The host will not be available for login or
application access during the upgrade. When the upgrade is finished, the
host will reboot under the newly upgraded RHEL major version. Now the
ops and app teams can assess if the upgrade was successful by verifying
all application services are working as expected.

==== *Commit*

If there are any application impacts discovered that can't be easily
corrected within the scheduled maintenance window, the decision can be
made to undo the upgrade by rolling back the snapshot. This will revert
all changes and return the host back to the previous RHEL version. If
there are no issues immediately found, the commit phase begins. During
the commit phase, the host can be returned to normal operation while
keeping the snapshot just in case any issues are uncovered later. After
everyone is comfortable with the upgraded host, the commit playbook
should be executed to delete the snapshot. The RHEL in-place upgrade is
done.

==== *Let's Get Started*

The RHEL in-place upgrade automation approach workflow is designed to
reduce the risks inherent in doing an in-place upgrade versus deploying
a new RHEL host. Decision points at the end of the analysis and upgrade
phases allow the process to be rolled back and restarted with the
benefit of lessons learned through reporting checks and actual upgrade
results. Of course, the best practice for avoiding production impacts or
outages is to proceed with upgrades in properly configured Dev and Test
environments before moving on to production hosts.

[#step-2-use-aap-to-launch-an-analysis-playbook-job]
=== Step 2 - Use AAP to Launch an Analysis Playbook Job

As we progress through the workshop, we'll refer back to this diagram to
track where we are in our automation approach workflow. We are starting
now in the highlighted block below:

image::ripu-workflow-hl-analysis.svg[Automation approach workflow diagram with analysis step highlighted]

The first step in upgrading our pet app hosts will be executing the
analysis playbook to generate the Leapp pre-upgrade report for each
host. To do this, we will use the Ansible Automation Platform (AAP)
automation controller host that has been pre-configured in your workshop
lab environment.

. Return to the AAP Web UI browser tab you opened in step 3 of the
previous exercise. Navigate to the ``Automation Execution`` drop down on
the lefthand side and select the ``Templates`` in the navigation menu. 
This will bring up a list of job templates that can be used to run playbook
jobs on target hosts:
+
image::aap_templates.png[Job templates listed on AAP Web UI]
. Click on the "AUTO / 01 Analysis" job template. This will display
the Details tab of the job template:
+
image::analysis_template.png["AUTO / 01 Analysis" job templates seen on AAP Web UI]
. From here, we could use the "Edit template" button if we wanted to make any
changes to the job template. This job template is already configured, so
we are ready to use it to submit a playbook job. To do this, use the
"Launch template" button which will bring up a series of prompts.
+
____
*Note*

The prompts that each job template presents can be configured using the
"Prompt on launch" checkboxes seen when editing a job template.
____
+
image::analysis_survey_prompt.png[Analysis job survey prompt on AAP Web UI]
. First we see the job template survey prompt. A survey is a customizable
set of prompts that can be configured from the Survey tab of the job
template. For this job template, the survey allows for choosing a group
of hosts on which the job will execute the playbook. Choose the
"ALL_rhel" option and click the "Next" button. This will bring you
to a preview of the selected job options and variable settings.
+

. If you are satisfied with the job preview, use the "Finish" button
to start the playbook job.

[#step-3-review-the-playbook-job-output]
=== Step 3 - Review the Playbook Job Output

After launching the analysis playbook job, the AAP Web UI will navigate
automatically to the job output page for the job you just started.

. While the playbook job is running, you can monitor its progress by
clicking the "Follow" button. When you are in follow mode, the output
will scroll automatically as task results are streamed to the bottom of
the job output shown in the AAP Web UI.
. The analysis playbook will run the Leapp pre-upgrade scan. This will
take about two or three minutes to complete. When it is done, you can
find a "PLAY RECAP" at the end of the job output, showing the success
or failure status for the playbook runs, executed on each host. A status
of "failed=0" indicates a successful playbook run. Scroll to the
bottom of the job output and you should see that your job summary looks
like this example:

[#step-4-challenge-lab-analysis-playbook]
=== Step 4 - Challenge Lab: Analysis Playbook

Let's take a closer look at the playbook we just ran.

____
*Tip*

Try looking at the configuration details of the "Project Leapp"
project and the "AUTO / 01 Analysis" job template.
____

Can you find the upstream source repo and playbook code?

____
*Warning*

*Solution below!*
____

. In the AAP Web UI, navigate to the ``Automation Execution`` drop down
and select the ``Projects`` menu on the lefthand side, then select ``ProjectLeapp``.
Under the Details tab, you will see the "Source Control URL" setting
that defines where job templates of this project will go to pull their
playbooks. We see it is pointing to this git repo on GitHub:
https://github.com/rhpds/leapp-project. Open this URL in a
new browser tab.
. Go back to the AAP Web UI and now navigate to the ``Automation Execution`` 
drop down and select the ``Templates`` menu, then select AUTO / 01 Analysis. 
Under the Details tab, you will see the "Playbook" setting with the 
name of the playbook this job template runs when it is used to submit 
a job. The playbook name is `analysis.yml`. In your GitHub browser tab, 
you can find `analysis.yml` listed in the files of the git repo. Click 
on it to see the playbook contents.
. Notice that the `Run RIPU preupg` task of the playbook is importing a
role from the `infra.leapp` Ansible collection. By checking the
`collections/requirements.yml` file in the git repo, we can discover
that this role comes from another git repo at
https://github.com/redhat-cop/infra.leapp. It is the `analysis` role
under this second git repo that provides all the automation tasks that
ultimately runs the Leapp pre-upgrade scan and generates the report.
. Drill down to the `roles/analysis` directory in this git repo to
review the README and yaml source files.

When you are ready to develop your own custom playbooks to run upgrades
for your enterprise, you should consider using roles from the
`infra.leapp` Ansible collection to make your job easier.

== Conclusion

In this exercise, we learned about the end-to-end workflow used by our
automation approach for doing RHEL in-place upgrades. We used a job
template in AAP to submit a playbook job that ran the Leapp pre-upgrade
analysis on our pet application servers. In the challenge lab, we
explored the playbook that we ran and how it includes a role from an
upstream Ansible collection.

In the next exercise, we will review the pre-upgrade reports we just
generated and take action to resolve any high-risk findings that were
identified.
